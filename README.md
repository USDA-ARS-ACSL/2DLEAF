A two-dimensional model (2DLEAF) of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration has been developed that explicitly accounts for gas diffusion through 
the boundary layer and the intercellular space as well as for stomatal regulation. This model was developed  by Ludmila and Yakov Pachepsky and Basil Acock

The model has been validated for tomato
See the manual folder for a manuscript describing the operation and theory

The example folder shows how to run the model

The project file compiles with Intel Fortran in Visual Studio. The program uses some QuickWin elements that can be removed easily
